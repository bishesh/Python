Script used to validate the PCA-based similarity metric.

Example:

python pca_registration.py -target_path target_dir/ -source_path source_path/ -dofout source_to_target.txt -out_path warped_source/ -v

where the target images (one image for 3D volume) are stored in the target_dir/ and the source images in source_dir/.

The source_to_target.txt file will contain the estimated rigid parameters mapping source to target, while the warped source images 
are saved in the out_path folder.

(under review).
